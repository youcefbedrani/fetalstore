# Google Sheets Integration Setup

## Current Status
‚úÖ Orders are being saved to Supabase successfully  
‚ùå Google Apps Script webhook is not working (returns "Moved Temporarily")  
‚úÖ Data is being logged in console for manual entry  

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Use Zapier (Recommended)
1. Go to [Zapier.com](https://zapier.com)
2. Create a new Zap
3. Choose "Webhooks" as trigger
4. Choose "Google Sheets" as action
5. Copy the webhook URL and add it to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK=your_zapier_webhook_url_here
   ```

### Option 2: Use Make.com (formerly Integromat)
1. Go to [Make.com](https://make.com)
2. Create a new scenario
3. Add "Webhook" trigger
4. Add "Google Sheets" action
5. Copy the webhook URL and add it to `.env.local`

### Option 3: Manual Entry (Current Working Solution)
The data is currently being logged in the console. You can:
1. Open browser console (F12) when making an order
2. Look for "üìã Google Sheets Entry:"
3. Copy the tab-separated data
4. Paste it into your Google Sheet

### Option 4: Fix Google Apps Script
1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the code from `google_apps_script_updated.js`
4. Deploy as Web App with these settings:
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
5. Copy the new webhook URL to `.env.local`

## Current Data Format
The system logs data in this format:
```
timestamp	name	phone	child_name	wilaya	baladia	address	quantity	total_price	image_url	created_at
```

## Testing
To test the integration:
1. Make a test order
2. Check the console logs
3. Look for "üìä Google Sheets API received data"
4. Check if webhook response shows success or failure

## Troubleshooting
- If you see "Moved Temporarily" error, the Google Apps Script is not properly deployed
- If you see "‚úÖ Data sent to Google Apps Script successfully", it's working
- If you see "‚ùå Google Apps Script failed", check the webhook URL and deployment
